Overview
========

This are my personal configs to configure my Alpha server with Chef (which is a Linode 512 machine).

Feel free to fork or whatever you want to do!

Notes
-----

Mainly I'm using Berkshelf to manage cookbooks dependencies (http://berkshelf.com) but you can use the cookbooks provided here (I'll sync them on every tag I create).

If you want to test some things you can use Vagrant (http://vagrant.com), don't forget to change my public ssh key on server user (data_bags/users/server) :P
